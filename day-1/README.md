# Day 1 – AI Voice Agent Running

I completed Day 1 of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge.

**What I set up**
- LiveKit backend (local Docker)
- React frontend for real-time voice interaction
- Deepgram STT integration
- Google Gemini LLM integration
- Murf Falcon TTS for voice output

**Notes**
- Local dev: LIVEKIT keys set to `testkey: testsecret`
- I removed cloud-only audio filters so it runs locally
- Demo video attached to LinkedIn post
