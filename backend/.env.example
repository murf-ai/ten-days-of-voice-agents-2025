# It looks like you're running into a connection error with LiveKit.
# To fix this, you'll need to provide your LiveKit server details.
#
# 1. If you don't have a LiveKit server, you can create a free account at https://livekit.io/
# 2. Once you have an account, create a new project and get your API key and secret.
# 3. You will also need the websocket URL for your server, which will look something like this:
#    wss://your-project-name.livekit.cloud
#
# Once you have these details, create a file named .env in this directory (backend/)
# and add the following lines, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

LIVEKIT_URL=
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=

# After creating the .env file, you will also need to provide a Google API key
# as the agent is now configured to use the Gemini API.
# You can get one from Google AI Studio.
# Add the following line to your .env file:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=
