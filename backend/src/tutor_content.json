    "title": "Variables",
    "summary": "Variables are containers that store data values. Think of them like labeled boxes where you can put information and retrieve it later. In programming, you give a variable a name and assign it a value. For example, 'age = 25' creates a variable called 'age' that stores the number 25. Variables are useful because they let you reuse values throughout your code without typing them repeatedly, and you can change their values as your program runs.",

    "id": "loops",
    "title": "Loops",
    "summary": "Loops are programming structures that repeat a block of code multiple times. There are two main types: 'for loops' which repeat a specific number of times, and 'while loops' which repeat as long as a condition is true. For example, a for loop might count from 1 to 10, while a while loop might keep asking for user input until they type 'quit'. Loops save you from writing the same code over and over again.",

    "id": "functions",
    "title": "Functions",
    "summary": "Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. You define a function once with a name and parameters, then you can 'call' it whenever you need that task done. Functions help organize code, make it more readable, and avoid repetition. For example, you might create a function called 'calculate_total' that adds up numbers, and then use it multiple times in your program without rewriting the addition logic.",

    "id": "conditionals",
    "title": "Conditionals (If Statements)",
    "summary": "Conditionals allow your program to make decisions based on conditions. The most common is the 'if statement' which checks if something is true, and if so, runs certain code. You can also use 'else' for what happens when the condition is false, and 'elif' (else if) for multiple conditions. For example, 'if temperature > 30: print(hot)' checks the temperature and responds accordingly. Conditionals make programs dynamic and responsive.",

    "id": "arrays",
    "title": "Arrays and Lists",
    "summary": "Arrays (or lists in Python) are collections that store multiple values in a single variable. Instead of creating separate variables for each item, you can store them all in one list. For example, 'fruits = [apple, banana, orange]' stores three fruits in one variable. You can access items by their position (index), add new items, remove items, and loop through all items. Lists are essential for working with collections of data.",
